I wish I'd started keeping a devlog earlier. I guess I did a few recordings on
youtube, but lately I haven't felt like streaming coding sessions.

So: there are a few things I'm trying to find solutions for. 

The first is that my auto-generated sliding scale is totally unreadable. The 
orbit of Venus is very close to 8/13s of Earth's, which is causing my tick marks 
to overlap each other. One idea would be to have two lines for Venus and smartly
place tick marks on one or the other to maximize readability. Another would be
to code up some complicated logic for finding all tick mark positions, guessing
how big the rendered text would be, and automatically placing the text so it
doesn't overlap. Maybe something like:
                      8
                   40 |
                 80 | |
                  | | |
... --------------+-+-+------ ...

The next problem is kind of a minor one. The default planet symbols in whatever
font is getting used by the SVG text elements don't look nice (to me). I think
I'll probably just need to draw them in inkscape or something. Or maybe I could
find some nice drawings online.

The other thing I'm working on is finding a way to produce the reference card.
One idea is to just drawit inkscape, which is honestly fine as an option, 
given that I have no immediate plans to support other print sizes. And just
manually making a reference card for each print size isn't that big of a deal,
just re-flow the text and maybe move some images around.

I've been trying to think of a way to handle predicting the Moon's position. 
The main idea I have right now is to add two scale to the transparent sheet
(above all the other sliding scales). One has markings for dates and times 
of day for one orbit of the moon, and the other is like all the other
sliding scales (it would be like the Mercury scale, and would have 11
indices). Let me go make a drawing...
