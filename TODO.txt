IN CODE
[x] Change everything to be in units of millimetres and scale it to
    the correct size (say credit card size)
[ ] Add ecliptic to star chart
    [ ] With date markers
[ ] Add "time-of-day line" on lawhat somewhere in south sky
    -> A.K.A. Sidereal Time Scale
[ ] Add a second date line on 'ankabut (aligned with time-of-day line on lawhat)
    including equation of time correction
    [ ] With a portion offset below for daylight savings time
MANUALLY?
[ ] Add numbers to lawhat grid
[ ] Local sky looks... not super nice... try to improve it
[ ] Star chart looks really bad. Improve it
    - Since this will be printed on regular paper (or maybe some kind
      of opaque pastic) I can use colours more easily. I found a
      planisphere that uses yellow for stars, red for constellations,
      and blue for deep sky objects. It uses green to mark the ecliptic.
    - Changing the size of the dots based on a star's magnitude looks good.
      Dominic Ford's charts are kind of insane in that they use Bézier 
      curves to trace around a filled circle (also, they don't use SVG
      text elements, looks like some kind of text-to-path thing that
      was done at generation time)
    - Only labeling bright or well-known star names
[ ] Create reference card
    [ ] Basic instructions
    [ ] Example: when will sun rise and set on November 22?
    [ ] Example: In which months is Orion visible?
    [ ] Magnetic north correction table for the next few years
    [ ] Timezone correction for different cities (i.e. difference 
        between local time and timezone time)
    [ ] Make sure to write on 'ankabut that it's calibrated to Toronto's latitude
[ ] Could add a protractor for measuring the sun's angle
    [ ] We have two flat sheets, there must be some clever way to 
        measure the elevation of an object in the sky with that...
