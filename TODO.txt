[x] Change everything to be in units of millimetres and scale it to
    the correct size (say credit card size)
[x] Tidy up the coordinates. Right now there's some super weird
    stuff to map things into the range -180 to +180, when what
    I really want is to go from 360 to 0
[x] Ahhhh.... the IAU-CSN only has named stars, but there are tons of
    visible starts that aren't named.... damn, I think I need to go back
    to BSC5
[x] Add ecliptic to 'ankabut
    [x] With True Sun date markers on the curve itself
[x] Add a second date line on 'ankabut (aligned with sidereal time line on lawhat) for standard time
    [x] With a portion offset below for daylight savings time
[x] Add in constellation line art
    [ ] Prob should add constellation labels too
    [ ] (And maybe label a few stars)
[ ] Make versions for other cultures' constellations
[x] Add "time-of-day line" on lawhat somewhere in south sky
    -> A.K.A. Sidereal Time Scale
[/] Add numbers to lawhat grid
[x] Are my constellations mirrored???
    -> No, they seem fine
[x] Add some visual distinction between am/pm
[ ] Local sky looks... not super nice... try to improve it
[ ] Star chart looks really bad. Improve it
    - Since this will be printed on regular paper (or maybe some kind
      of opaque pastic) I can use colours more easily. I found a
      planisphere that uses yellow for stars, red for constellations,
      and blue for deep sky objects. It uses green to mark the ecliptic.
    - Changing the size of the dots based on a star's magnitude looks good.
      Dominic Ford's charts are kind of insane in that they use Bézier 
      curves to trace around a filled circle (also, they don't use SVG
      text elements, looks like some kind of text-to-path thing that
      was done at generation time)
    - Only labeling bright or well-known star names
[ ] Create reference card
    [/] Basic instructions
    [ ] Example: when will sun rise and set on November 22?
    [/] Example: In which months is Orion visible?
    [ ] Magnetic north correction table for the next few years
    [ ] Timezone correction for different cities (i.e. difference 
        between local time and timezone time)
    [x] Make sure to write on lawhat that it's calibrated to Toronto's latitude
[ ] Put RA/DE grid lines on 'ankabut?
[x] Try out orrery nomogram idea
    [ ] is there any clever transform we can apply that would let us 
        place things in a nicer scale? Probably not.
[x] Figure out a solution for including Jupiter and Saturn
    -> Maybe having two separate nomograms 
[/] If I do keep the orrery nomogram, I really need to improve the
    readability and aesthetics
    [ ] Need to add in planet labels
    [ ] For Jupiter/Saturn try to vary tick lengths to make it easier
        to read months
[ ] Do the date addition slide rule
    [ ] How to deal with the unreadable mess this is generating...
[ ] Figure out how to get double-sided prints on card
    [ ] Need reference card and orrery on backside
[ ] Need a more sane way to produce the PDFs I send for printing
[ ] Version française


OTHER
[ ] Write README/CONTRIBUTING/LICENSE
[ ] Do a nicer write-up of how I adapted the graphics gems method
[ ] Maybe try to release curve-fitter as a library for people to use
[ ] Maybe try to release the debugger as a library
[ ] Could add a protractor for measuring the sun's angle
    [ ] We have two flat sheets, there must be some clever way to 
        measure the elevation of an object in the sky with that...
